                  How do contemporary filmmakers use cinematic techniques to address social and political issues?</br>
                  As contemporary film and cinematography are considered a reflection of numerous societal and political values,
                  it is not atypical for contemporary filmmakers to utilize cinematic techniques as potent devices to convey and
                  explore such issues. Through means of narrative framework, visual stimulation, and the art of cinematography,
                  filmmakers have successfully delivered them to the audiences. Thus, this essay aims to discuss such methods
                  in the aforementioned context.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Firstly, with a fixation on the effectiveness of narrative structure in addressing political issues, the movie
                  “Black Panther” offered a good number of details from the plot’s progression, as director Ryan Coogler examined
                  themes of power struggle, resource conflict, and the correlation between personal discord and nationwide dispute.
                  The dual narrative sophisticatedly implemented in the film shows discordance stemming from power, exemplified by
                  T’Challa’s quest to reclaim the throne alongside Killmonger’s desire for revenge. Significantly, the ritual combat
                  challenge illustrated how personal vendettas could be amplified into national conflicts, reflecting the real-life
                  event in 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria’s assassination, one of the key triggers of World War I.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Furthermore, the battles over vibranium recall struggle over declining natural resources such as fossil fuels,
                  which mirrored the harsh reality of our current era and sparked critical discussion; delivered through the excellent
                  storytelling framework.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On another note, with regards to the enforcement of visual symbolism in capturing societal matters, “Parasite” by
                  director Bong Joon-Ho proves itself to be nothing less than an ideal case in point. In the film, issues of class
                  inequality, wealth disparity, and social injustice are clearly and tactically displayed through contrasting color schemes
                  and the distinction between the lavish, intricate architectural designs of the Park family’s home and the impoverished
                  settings of the Kim family’s apartment, as well as the interpretation of rain as a gift by the Parks whilst a hazard to
                  the Kims. These not only reflect but also dramatize the social disparities between the affluent and the poor, further
                  exploring themes of class struggles and inequity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Comparably, the cinematography of “The Great Gatsby”, directed by Baz Luhrmann, provides insight into similar topics
                  of societal gaps and moral corruption of the 1920s. Using elite camera work and imagery, the stark division between
                  the old-money area of East Egg, the nouveau riche village of West Egg, and the devastated Valley of Ashes was well-demonstrated.
                  The dynamic 3D technique emphasizes the extravagance of both affluent settlements whilst still implicitly marking their distance,
                  both spatially and figuratively, through peculiar and unique camera shots such as plunging across the water of the bay from West Egg.
                  Likewise, the slow shots framing the Valley of Ashes highlight its distinction from the remaining two areas. The overall cinematography
                  of the film not only departs a visually stunning experience to viewers but also shows economic and social discrepancy alongside its impact
                  on moral ethics.
                </p>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                  In conclusion, cinematic elements are frequently harnessed to display and discuss political and social matters through the proficient
                  employment of modern filmmakers. This has undoubtedly offered audiences a profound approach to and a greater understanding of such
                  controversial topics. As the film industry continues to innovate, the extensive impact of these techniques in catalyzing thought and
                  discussion will certainly continue to flourish in the hands of talented film producers for years to come.

                  “The Grand Budapest Hotel”, directed by Wes Anderson, is a quirky and meaningful comedy-drama film that not only perfectly exemplifies the unique style of films by the same director but also heavily underlines themes of human morality, friendship, and nostalgia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The film involves multiple layers of narration, creating an intriguing atmosphere for the setting of the main story. The movie’s plot follows the adventures of the great concierge Gustave H. and his lobby boy, Zero Mustafa, as they navigate the worlds of the affluent, the imprisoned, and the runaway fugitive amidst all the drama involving a dead dowager and a famous painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What truly makes this film stand out is its symmetrical style and uniquely vibrant color palette unlike most cinematic works nowadays, blended seamlessly with the whimsical storyline and witty dialogue, creating a truly magnificent viewer experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond this first impression, the film’s melancholic depth also facilitates feelings of grief, nostalgia, and bittersweet as we are reminded of an era long past, with the hotel itself as its symbol.

                  As a memory-jogging, tear-jerking cinematic experience, “Mua Do” (or “Red Rain”) has accomplished its primary mission phenomenally. Portraying a slice of wartime’s bilateral tragedy alongside the collective strengths towards patriotism of Vietnamese people, the film utilized the perfect recipe of cinematography, moral standpoint, drama, and nostalgia to formulate one of the most well-received motion pictures in Vietnam as of 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike its predecessors of common theme, the movie approached war from two opposite perspectives — a relatively novel route in Vietnamese historical cinema. In other words, instead of simplifying the image of the Southern Vietnamese soldier into a single stereotype, it strived to fully paint the humane aspect of both sides of the battlefield. From the Democratic Republic of Vietnam’s side, we follow the trail of Cuong, a warrior fighting to defend Quang Tri Citadel. And from the Republic of Vietnam, we see through the eyes of Quang, an officer tasked with retaking said fortress. The tragedies of war are illustrated through their lenses, with both going through the complex emotional fluctuations of war.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am particularly intrigued by the mental process of Quang, the supposed antagonist, since he displays a subtle internal struggle between his moralities and his regime that could easily be overlooked upon first impression — an intricate element that the protagonist Cuong understandably lacks. While Quang does possess a certain degree of empathy and compassion for the people, he unfortunately was born and raised into the circumstances where he must serve for his system. This inner turmoil is best depicted in his meaningful interactions with his mother — how he hesitated to go to war when she called his name, or through his rescue and eventual affection of Hong, a nurse from the opposite side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Going back to the dual-narrative concept, not only are the agonies of war directly characterized through the main characters on the front lines, but they are also personified through the individuals awaiting them at home. This is embodied exceptionally well in Cuong and Quang’s moms both grieving their losses at the end of the movie — a cinematic scene portrayed by an elaborate transition between them mourning in front of each son’s respective grave, as well as the camera panning over the river where the grieving mothers, along with others, dropped flowers in memory of their loved ones. Even though the florals varied in color, they were of the same species and being dropped into the same river — a symbolization of how despite their sons fighting on opposing sides, in the end, both mothers shared the same pain and sorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the movie, we also witness the friendships formed within wartime being exemplified by Cuong’s troop — a team unified from all three regions: Northern, Central, and Southern Vietnam. Each carried a unique backstory but all rallied to fight for their country: two students abandoning their academic pursuits of arts and music, an underage soldier dropping out of high school and writing a letter with his own blood to join the army, a husband and father with an awaiting family at home,... Through hardships, they bonded and fought, never once losing sight of hope.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In between the intense battle scenes, we also see cherished memories of their shared lives — ones of sworn brothers rather than just mere teammates. We witness their rusticity and plainness when guns and bullets are put aside through seemingly simple details: Ta questioning what his descendants would think if his letter had a misspelling, or Tu adopting a small bird even in the midst of war. More than just a symbol of Tu’s young innocence, this bird also epitomizes their yearn for peace and freedom, and is passed down for the final-standing soldier of the troop, Tan, to release at the end of the film. Through such miniscule factors being laid out within the plot, the entire movie’s narrative reaches an even more phenomenal level overall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And of course, “Mua Do” would not be complete without its distinct hues of patriotism. In one of the major scenes, Cuong’s teammate Hai is captured by the Southern Vietnamese soldiers, tied to a tree, and forced to announce disheartening remarks to his comrades through a loudspeaker in exchange for a chance to live. Instead, he shouts out his final words before being set on fire: “Do not lose faith. Do not surrender. Victory will be ours!” We could also observe the scenes where the patriotic soldiers risk their lives to prevent the enemy from planting their flag atop the citadel, or Cuong’s determination to return to the battlefield to fight for his country instead of remaining in the home front after being hospitalized due to serious wounds. With this spirit, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam managed to prevail in the end, although not without numerous significant losses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the film’s initial release, the diverse range of feedback reflected different takes on this agenda-filled movie. Most praised it as a cinematic masterpiece that fully displayed the cruelty of war and touched the hearts of many viewers. However, it has also stirred up some debate concerning the creative extent an adaptation of history could reach before it loses authenticity and credibility. The line between artistic freedom and fiction is marginally narrow, so filmmakers of this genre need to be extremely cautious with their research and choice of content. In the case of “Mua Do”, historians and true survivors from the war have criticized some major details in the film being altered from real events.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The movie implied that the entire 81-day battle happened within the heart of Quang Tri Citadel, whereas in reality, up until the 74th day, the conflict solely happened in the surrounding area, including landmarks such as Tri Buu Church, Sai Market, Hanh Hoa Village,... and it was not until the 79th day that the fights within the Citadel officially commenced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another misleading detail is the correlation between The Paris Peace Accords and the Quang Tri battle: in the movie’s interpretation, the soldiers’ withdrawal from the Citadel is implicitly attributed to the signing of the Peace Accords; however, in actual fact, Democratic Republic of Vietnam forces withdrew from Quang Tri in September of 1972, while the Paris Peace Accords were not signed until January 27, 1973, following the “Dien Bien Phu in the Air” victory in late December 1972. This implication could lead to the misunderstanding that the battle of Quang Tri produced the agreement’s outcome, whereas in fact, it was the victory in the skies over Hanoi that brought the opposing factions back to the negotiating table.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, it must also be stressed that the overly harsh and rigid criticism from researchers and the public towards historical films could detrimentally affect filmmakers’ willingness to explore such themes in the future. Hence, some lenience should be given in order to allow space for creativity, as long as historical truth is not slandered or distorted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From a technical aspect, the film displays great consistency throughout, utilizing symmetrical elements such as a choir being used as background sound in the start, its composition by Cuong being portrayed in the middle of the movie, and the appearance of the choir in the end of the film, showing how even though Cuong has long gone, his legacy and patriotic spirit still lived on. Storytelling is encompassed from a holistic approach and combined with marvelous camera work, marking a breakthrough for the Vietnamese movie industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From my view, despite its imperfections, as a film that manages to pull at the viewers’ heartstrings whilst simultaneously working as an instrument to spread awareness about history and culture, “Mua Do” definitely encapsulates all the elements of a must-see masterpiece. It is highly recommended that one should approach this work on a neutral ground, with consideration for the efforts of a developing movie industry like Vietnam’s, while also taking in the flaws critically as a hallmark for their future pieces.
                </p>

                  The moment I stepped into the cinema at 12 years old in 2020, about to watch a movie I thought was just like any other thriller I’ve witnessed and will see in my lifetime, never would I have expected to find a timeless masterpiece bearing a lasting impression that would urge me to go back and back again to rewatch every year without fail. It was a re-run of the 2012 gem, “The Tower” — an immensely underrated South Korean disaster film which explores the topics of social disparities and morality, coated in stunning visuals and effects — a true emotional roller-coaster ride.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Set on Christmas Eve, the main plot of the cinematic piece revolves around a lavish-party-turned-disastrous-inferno at one of the twin landmark buildings of Sky Tower — the most luxurious complex in Seoul, catered to the elites of society. When snow is sprinkled from helicopters to impress the guests at the party, catastrophe lurks around the corner. As one of the aircraft crashes into the tower, a fire ignites and quickly spreads throughout the building. Chaos erupts as all the inhabitants frantically attempt to flee, leaving their fate in the hands of a brave team of firefighters to protect them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Concerning the cinematic and technical aspects, the film utilizes a combination of both real images and CGI, exhibiting an impressively realistic yet majestic setting. Scenes such as the firefighter captain single-handedly battling the fires or the civilians free-falling in the elevator keep audiences on the edge of their seats, creating an extraordinary and unique viewing experience. The soundtrack and color palette also contribute largely to the mood-setting of the film, fabricating a cozy holiday atmosphere at the beginning, a breath-taking suspense in the climax scenes, and a sorrowful undertone towards the ending.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thematically, the movie succeeds in portraying the harsh realities of society, cleverly interleaving details such as the revolted attitude of the old money towards the nouveau riche as well as the authorities’ command to prioritize saving a small minority of elites instead of the many other middle-class individuals. From this root cause arise notions of greed and negligence: the disaster stems from the building owner’s reckless decision to hold the extravagant party featuring helicopters, despite safety warnings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the same time, the film does not forgo the rich humanities and ethical values still intact even in such a corrupt world. From the last-minute choice of participating even though he was off-duty to spend Christmas with his wife, to his eventual sacrifice to rescue the remaining survivors, Captain Young-ki embodies the epitome of a selfless warrior, always choosing others over himself. We also witness this ideology being demonstrated in a different approach through the remaining main character, Lee Dae-ho, where he transitions from a private morality — saving just his daughter, to a communal one — saving others in danger. From the sole purpose of finding his child, he starts helping strangers along the way and coordinating with the rescue efforts of the firefighters. Unlike Young-ki, he is not a hero in the traditional sense, but rather stands as a moral counterpoint, proving that even the most ordinary of men are capable of doing the extraordinary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the day, “The Tower” is undoubtedly a sensational treasure in the cinematic industry, not only for its technical artistry and visual grandeur, but most especially for its spectacular narrative structure and the various ethical messages conveyed throughout the film. To me, the fictional tower may have fallen to its end, but it was exactly at that moment that the beginning of my intimate journey with the silver screen slowly arose.
